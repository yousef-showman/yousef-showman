Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m Yousef Showman, a computer science student with a strong interest in backend development and high-performance computing (HPC). I enjoy building efficient systems and experimenting with performance.

These days I’m focused on:

Backend development 

High-Performance Computing & parallel programming 

Machine Learning & Computer Vision (driver drowsiness detection)

Competitive programming & algorithmic problem solving
